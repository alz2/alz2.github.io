I'm currently a rising Senior at University of Illinois At Urbana Champiagn studying Computer Science. 
I'm currently interested in most things revolving around big data; that is, discovering insights, learning statistical models, creating cool visualizations, and other things!
I'm also interested in a bunch of things I have very limited experience in, like computer vision and augmented reality.
However, if you were to ask me what topic I would do potentially write a thesis about, I wouldn't be able to tell you since I'm still trying to pinpoint the topic that really resonates with me -- but I'll be sure to update this once I find out! 
This semester (SP19), I studied data mining, programming languages, and social data visualizations. 
Next semester (FA19), I plan on studying computational photography, natural language processing, and computer security.
In my free time (and when I'm not writing more code), I enjoy going to the gym, playing soccer, and beating my roommate at Smash Ultimate.
